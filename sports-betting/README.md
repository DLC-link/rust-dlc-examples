alice and bob are meeting up to watch the duke/unc basketball game. alice is studying business at unc, and bob is recovering from a CS250 project at duke. both have strong convicton about their team winning tonight's game and want to bet on it. i wrote this tutorial for them, so that they can use a discreet log contract to facilitate their wager!

this tutorial assumes a knowledge of discreet log contracts with enumerated outcomes. if the reader finds himself without this knowledge, i recommend [this set of blog posts](https://suredbits.com/discreet-log-contracts-part-1-what-is-a-discreet-log-contract/).

as an exercise, see if you can add multiple oracles to help mitigate risk and try to make an event with more outcomes (e.g. election results)
