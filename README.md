# rust-dlc examples

* sports-betting (beginner): the most simple type of discreet log contract with only two outcomes
* degen-leverage (advanced) [TODO]: learn how to do efficient numerical outcome decomposition, multi-oracle redundancy and oracle error tolerance

these examples exclusively serve a pedagogical purpose. neither use these contracts on mainnet, nor assume their correctness.
